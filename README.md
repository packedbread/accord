Discord conversation unicast.

Currently uses conversations from [Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html).

## How to use
```shell script
$ ./main.py <webhook-url>
```

Where `<webhook-url>` looks like this:
```
https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/{webhook.id}/{webhook.token}
```

For more info refer to [discord docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)
